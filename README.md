### About
-----

QueueSimulator is a free software which aims to simulate primarily
G/G/k queueing systems that are used in computer networks. But
it can be used to simulate practically any stable queue system.

##### On Windows :

Double click on queuesimulator.jar to run.

### How to use
----------

1 - Enter the parameters to simulate the system :
Server amount - number of parallel servers
Transmission rate - contant transmission rate per server in bps
Queue buffer size - maximum queue size in bits

2 - Specify "Packet Arrival Time Distribution" and "Packet Size Distribution" fields.
You can find more information about distributions in the DISTRIBUTION_INFO.md file.

3 - Select the termination method of simulation;
In terms of input package number
In terms of simulation clock
In terms of computation time

4 - Select the data delay field between %0 and %50.
Data delay field specifies the percentage of simulation data that 
will be discarded until the specified amount is reached. 
Necessary for isolating the stable state data.

5 - Press simulate and observe results.
